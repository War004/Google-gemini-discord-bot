# Google-gemini-discord-bot
A Python program that lets you use Google's Gemini API to create an interactive bot for the platform 'discord'.["GOOGLE_API_KEY","DISCORD_TOKEN"]

Remember to save the API key to 'secrets' in Google Colab or in the environmental variable if used on the device. 

Currently, this version is made for personal use in mind, which can be found in the code. 
The bot remembers the chat based on the user ID, this means you could continue the conversation between different servers and also edit the conversation in the log text file that is created. 
Also, multiple users can't be in a single conversation as mentioned above the bot uses chat history to save a log file in the storage and when a different responds(i.e. via replying to one of the bot responses or mentioning the bot.[Doesn't support dm])
